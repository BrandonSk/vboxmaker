# vboxmaker
A script to manage and automate creation of virtual box machines. With this script you can create "thousands" of Virtualbox machines in seconds. The script here is for backup purposes only and not everything might work in newer versions of VirtualBox. However, the basic functionality should work. Feel free to expand the script.
