# vboxmaker / vboxgenie
A script to manage and automate creation of virtual box machines. With this script you can interactively manage VMs in shell. You can use a wizzard to create VMs, including features as raw access to disk, etc. If you use the "dump to script" feature of the wizzard, then the steps to create the VM will be dumped to a separate script, which you can later use to create "thousands" of Virtualbox machines in seconds.

## vboxgenie
The vboxgenie is another (newer) version, with some modified approaches. *I would recommend using this version of the script.*

The script here is for backup purposes only and not everything might work in newer versions of VirtualBox. I am no longer developing it. However, the basic functionality should work. Feel free to expand the script.
